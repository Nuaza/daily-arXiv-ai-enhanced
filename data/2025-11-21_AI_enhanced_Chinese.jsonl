Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols.

Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost.

This stems from a critical \\textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning.

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes.

In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Click2Graph\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5168\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u51fb\u6216\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5c01\u95ed\u7684\u524d\u9988\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u878d\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b\u800c\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u6216\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\u6267\u884c\u8054\u5408\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u8c13\u8bcd\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5272\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u8c61\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenPVSG\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cClick2Graph\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5168\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u63d0\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u5168\u666f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u5168\u666f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task.

Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08FADS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u91c7\u6837\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6c11\u65cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bf4\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u6539\u5584\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\uff08FADS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFADS\u59cb\u7ec8\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6c11\u65cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation.

However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AMS-KV\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0b\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u5b58\u50a8\u5173\u952e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684KV\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34KV\u5185\u5b58\u968f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u800c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5c40\u90e8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u8d21\u732e\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u4e3a\u6700\u7c97\u7cd9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u5c11\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u7f13\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5c42\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86AMS-KV\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5b58\u50a8\u5173\u952e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684KV\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0cAMS-KV\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1184.83%\uff0c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e60.48%\u3002\u5f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6279\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a128\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\uff0cAMS-KV\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6279\u5927\u5c0f256\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "AMS-KV\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0b\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684KV\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations.

This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains.

Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar.

However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation.

However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u76f2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u540cQP\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u5df2\u77e5QP\u7684\u975e\u76f2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u76f2QECV\u6280\u672f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u76f2\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9000\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u4ec5\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u9000\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u4f2a\u5f71\u53bb\u9664\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f2a\u5f71\u51cf\u5c11\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u76ee\u3002", "result": "\u5728QP=22\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u76f2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cPSNR\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86110%\uff08\u4ece0.31 dB\u52300.65 dB\uff09\uff1b\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u5728QP=22\u65f6\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4QP=42\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels.

However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEGO-SLAM\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\u523016\u7ef4\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u526a\u679d\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u56de\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u6210\u5230SLAM\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\u548c\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u573a\u666f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u538b\u7f29\u523016\u7ef4\u7d27\u51d1\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u5197\u4f59\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u56de\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc760%\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b015 FPS\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u6620\u5c04\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LEGO-SLAM\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863DGS-SLAM\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u5d4c\u5165\uff08RGE\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u5f0f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRGE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u9996\u5148\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5c55\u5f00\u540e\u63d0\u53d6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728MMEB\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4f7f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics.

This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\\% degradation in key objective metrics.

Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures.

The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \\emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLNG-SWR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c0f\u6ce2\u91cd\u6784\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u6e05\u6d01-\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6743\u8861\u548c\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5411\u591a\u4e2a\u5c42\u6ce8\u5165\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u9891\u7387\u504f\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c0f\u6ce2\u91cd\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u7387\u9002\u914d\uff1a\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u9891\u5e26\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fb9\u754c\u54cd\u5e94\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9891\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CT\u548c\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cLNG-SWR\u5728\u6e05\u6d01Dice/IoU\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u53e0\u52a0\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6e05\u6d01\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "LNG-SWR\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5de5\u7a0b\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684verbose-text\u8bf1\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb(VTIA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u826f\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fatoken\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5ef6\u8fdfEOS token\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6765\u9690\u5f0f\u5ef6\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8f93\u51fatoken\u957f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfcLLM\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2) \u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6270\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5236\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "VTIA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u80fd\u89e6\u53d1\u5197\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6076\u610f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity.

However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578bDSLGA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u89c1\u5149-\u7ea2\u5916\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u5171\u4eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5904\u7406\u57df\u95f4\u548c\u57df\u5185\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684VI-ReID\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94VI-ReID\uff0c\u5c06\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578bDSLGA\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u57df\u5171\u4eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565(DSLS)\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u57df\u95f4\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u65e0\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565(GAS)\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5230\u6574\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u5904\u7406\u57df\u5185\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684VI-ReID\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e9b\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DSLGA\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86UDA-VI-ReID\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u95f4\u548c\u57df\u5185\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLA-Fool\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "VLA-Fool\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7834\u574f\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u4f4d\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86VLA\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684OpenVLA\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5177\u8eab\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5177\u8eabVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module.

Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\\times$ and 1.7$\\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Texture3dgs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4f18\u5316\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85(3DGS)\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe4.1\u500d\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u52a0\u901f\u548c1.7\u500d\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c111.6\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c063DGS\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u79bb\u7ebf\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7eb9\u7406\u7f13\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u5e03\u5c40\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf93DGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cTexture3dgs\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.1\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6574\u4f533D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.7\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u4e861.6\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Texture3dgs\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps.

This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity.

In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "NaTex\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u751f\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u57283D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u7eb9\u7406\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7eb9\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u989c\u8272\u70b9\u4e91\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7f51\u683c\u7eb9\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u989c\u8272\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u989c\u8272\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u989c\u8272\u70b9\u4e91VAE\u548c\u591a\u63a7\u5236\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668(DiT)\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u4f7f\u75283D\u6570\u636e\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u539f\u751f\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3aDiT\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u63a53D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5171\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1VAE-DiT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u652f\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "NaTex\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6750\u8d28\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u5316\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "NaTex\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u751f3D\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf2D\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching.

However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors.

To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions.

Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image.

Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching.

Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86StreetView-Waste\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u5783\u573e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5783\u573e\u5bb9\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u6ea2\u51fa\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5783\u573e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5783\u573e\u5bb9\u5668\u6ea2\u51fa\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5783\u573e\u8f66\u62cd\u6444\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u6d41\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5783\u573e\u548c\u5783\u573e\u5bb9\u5668\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8865\u5145\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u5783\u573e\u5bb9\u5668\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5783\u573e\u5bb9\u5668\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u7ebf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8ba1\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8679.6%\uff1b\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5c06\u5206\u5272mAP@0.5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8627%\u3002", "conclusion": "StreetView-Waste\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u5783\u573e\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLA-Pruner\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3aVision-Language-Action\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684VLM\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\uff08\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cdVLA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVLA-Pruner\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u586b\u5145\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e3\u7801\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6807\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4fdd\u7559\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVLA-Pruner\u5728\u591a\u79cdVLA\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "VLA-Pruner\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728VLA\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLaVA\u00b3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7075\u611f\u6765\u81ea\u7acb\u4f53\u4e3b\u4e49\u7ed8\u753b\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b33D\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u76842D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf93D\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d23D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684omnidirectional\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c063D\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5168\u65b9\u4f4d\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D\u56fe\u50cf\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u548c3D\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u7684VLM\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "LLaVA\u00b3\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLM\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks.

Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u70b9\u6d41\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u6d41\uff09\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u4fee\u6539\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u878d\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u70b9\u6d41\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee5\u70b9\u6d41\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u6ca1\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u6001\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u70b9\u6d41\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f5c\u8005\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset.

Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SemCLIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6765\u6539\u8fdbCLIP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u3001\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301CLIP\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u91ca\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5426\u5b9a\u4f1a\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u5316\u6839\u672c\u6539\u53d8\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u91ca\u4e49\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u4f46\u76f8\u540c\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemCLIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684CLIP\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e94\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u3001\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\uff09\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3CLIP\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728CC-Neg\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece68.1%\u63d0\u5347\u523078.1%\uff1b\u5728Sugarcrepe++\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eCLIP\u3002", "conclusion": "SemCLIP\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u663e\u8457\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301CLIP\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \\revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4f53\u64cd\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u4f53\u64cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f53\u64cd\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u89e3\u51b3\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f53\u64cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u573a\u5730\u7a7a\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u670d\u88c5\u548c\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u89c6\u89d2\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u786e\u5b9a3D\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4f53\u64cd\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u54583D\u4e2d\u5fc3\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5782\u76f4\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c04\u7ebf-\u5e73\u9762\u76f8\u4ea4\u751f\u6210\u5171\u97623D\u8f68\u8ff9\u5019\u9009\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea7\u8054\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5f53\u4ea4\u53c9\u89c6\u89d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u5145\u8db3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5c04\u7ebf-\u5e73\u9762\u76f8\u4ea4\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u4f53\u64cd\u88c1\u5224\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u4f53\u64cd\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u56fd\u9645\u4f53\u64cd\u8054\u5408\u4f1a\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7ea7\u8054\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f53\u64cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.\n  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches .

Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization.

However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.\n  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT.

In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims.

Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "TriDiff-4D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d4D\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76844D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9aa8\u67b6\u9a71\u52a8\u76844D\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67094D\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u63a74D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u76844D\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a3D\u5e27\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u3002\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u83033D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u6dfb\u52a0\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u76844D\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "TriDiff-4D\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u6570\u79d2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "conclusion": "TriDiff-4D\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a4D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization.

Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDualMindVLM\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u5207\u6362\u5feb\u901f\u601d\u8003\u548c\u6162\u901f\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u90fd\u8ffd\u6c42\u5197\u957f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e24\u7cfb\u7edf\u601d\u8003\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u6216\u6162\u901f\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u548c\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "DualMindVLM\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6781\u9ad8\u7684token\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning.

To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\\sim$3\\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images.

For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate \"ground-truth\" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
