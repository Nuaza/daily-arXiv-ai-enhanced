A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u578b\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u9762\u4e34giga\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u75c5\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u6709\u5305\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u800cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u63cf\u8ff0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u5411\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u578b\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u75c5\u7406\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u539f\u578b\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u539f\u578b\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5197\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u878d\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7acb\u4f53\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u764c\u75c7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u75c5\u7406\u5b9e\u4f53\u539f\u578b\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM). Accepted Manuscript version uploaded", "summary": "Extracting robust discriminative features is a critical challenge in person re-identification (ReID). While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research. Our proposed ReIDMamba model boasts only one-third the parameters of TransReID, along with lower GPU memory usage and faster inference throughput. Experimental results demonstrate ReIDMamba's superior and promising performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks.

Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

While recent vision-language models achieve strong results in general radiology report generation, they often fail to adequately describe rare but clinically important pathologies like fractures. This work addresses this gap by developing specialized models for fracture pathology detection and description.

We introduce Context-Semantic Fusion Network (CSF-Net), a transformer-based fusion framework that fuses these candidates with contextual features to produce a semantic guidance image for image inpainting.

CSF-Net can be seamlessly integrated into existing inpainting models without architectural changes and consistently enhances performance across diverse masking conditions.

We present EAGLE, a novel framework that leverages episodic appearance- and geometry-aware memory to achieve unified 2D-3D visual query localization in egocentric vision. Inspired by avian memory consolidation, EAGLE synergistically integrates segmentation guided by an appearance-aware meta-learning memory (AMM), with tracking driven by a geometry-aware localization memory (GLM). This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating the VQL-2D output with a visual geometry grounded Transformer (VGGT), we achieve a efficient unification of 2D and 3D tasks, enabling rapid and accurate back-projection into 3D space.

This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels.

While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments.

While prior research has emphasized algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content, especially under varying reconstruction conditions, remains largely underexplored. In practice, factors such as viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions can significantly degrade visual quality, yet their perceptual impact has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present 3DGS-QA, the first subjective quality assessment dataset for 3DGS. It comprises 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, enabling a controlled investigation of common distortion factors. Based on this dataset, we introduce a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives, without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references. Our model extracts spatial and photometric cues from the Gaussian representation to estimate perceived quality in a structure-aware manner.

Modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on large-scale diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable world understanding capabilities that benefit for various vision tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in MDE through fine-tuning these VFMs. Inspired by these developments, we propose WEDepth, a novel approach that adapts VFMs for MDE without modi-fying their structures and pretrained weights, while effec-tively eliciting and leveraging their inherent priors. Our method employs the VFM as a multi-level feature en-hancer, systematically injecting prior knowledge at differ-ent representation levels. Experiments on NYU-Depth v2 and KITTI datasets show that WEDepth establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, achieving competi-tive results compared to both diffusion-based approaches (which require multiple forward passes) and methods pre-trained on relative depth.

Existing approaches either collapse this variability into a consensus mask or rely on separate model branches for each annotator. We introduce ProSona, a two-stage framework that learns a continuous latent space of annotation styles, enabling controllable personalization via natural language prompts. A probabilistic U-Net backbone captures diverse expert hypotheses, while a prompt-guided projection mechanism navigates this latent space to generate personalized segmentations. A multi-level contrastive objective aligns textual and visual representations, promoting disentangled and interpretable expert styles. Across the LIDC-IDRI lung nodule and multi-institutional prostate MRI datasets, ProSona reduces the Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by more than one point compared with DPersona.

A common approach to localize objects across multiple sizes is to merge backbone features of different resolutions. Furthermore, to enable small object detection in densely populated regions, the input image is commonly upsampled and tiling is applied to cope with the increased computational and memory requirements. Because of these ad-hoc solutions, existing counters struggle with images containing diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions of small objects. We propose GECO2, an end-to-end few-shot counting and detection method that explicitly addresses the object scale issues. A new dense query representation gradually aggregates exemplar-specific feature information across scales that leads to high-resolution dense queries that enable detection of large as well as small objects.

However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality.

However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Stable Diffusion\u7b49\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81eaCLIP\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3b\u8981\u5145\u5f53\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u6765\u81ea\u6a21\u578b\u54ea\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Stable Diffusion\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u56de\u5f52\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u6210\u529f\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8eCLIP\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u800c\u975e\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c5e\u6027\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u9010\u6e10\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "CLIP\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3b\u8981\u627f\u62c5\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u529f\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency. We validate our framework across four state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically designed to stress-test generative models. It comprises 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types, including underrepresented categories such as anthropomorphic and animated characters, and captures an average of six to seven transformation axes per prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aBeyond the Pixels\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5c06\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5177\u4f53\u8f6c\u6362\u5206\u6790\u800c\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u5d4c\u5165\u6216\u7c97\u7565\u7684VLM\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8eab\u4efd\u53d8\u5316\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e3a(\u7c7b\u578b,\u98ce\u683c)\u2192\u5c5e\u6027\u2192\u7279\u5f81\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u793a\u5177\u4f53\u8f6c\u6362\u800c\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u89e3\u5c06VLM\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5305\u542b1078\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf-\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e3b\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u548c6-7\u4e2a\u8f6c\u6362\u8f74\u3002", "conclusion": "Beyond the Pixels\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u8f6c\u6362\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8eab\u4efd\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing.

However, these systems remain vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs), which can significantly compromise their reliability. In this work, we introduce a new dataset focused on a novel and realistic presentation attack instrument called Nylon Face Masks (NFMs), designed to simulate advanced 3D spoofing scenarios. NFMs are particularly concerning due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance, which enable them to closely mimic the victim's facial geometry when worn by an attacker. To reflect real-world smartphone-based usage conditions, we collected the dataset using an iPhone 11 Pro, capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins. We benchmark the dataset using five state-of-the-art PAD methods to evaluate their robustness under unseen attack conditions.

This work is part of the Zerovision project. Code available at: https://github.com/ertis-research/zerovision", "summary": "Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548cSAM2\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u6ce1\u6cab\u81ea\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u6ce1\u6cab\u5f62\u6210\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u4e4b\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408SAM2\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff08\u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03SAM2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Flower\u6846\u67b6\u7531\u4e2d\u592eFog\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u800c\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6ce1\u6cab\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6c61\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u81ea\u52a8\u6ce1\u6cab\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6ce8\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose PEOD, the first large-scale, pixel-aligned and high-resolution (1280 x 720) Event-RGB dataset for object detection under challenge conditions. PEOD contains 130+ spatiotemporal-aligned sequences and 340k manual bounding boxes, with 57% of data captured under low-light, overexposure, and high-speed motion. Furthermore, we benchmark 14 methods across three input configurations (Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion) on PEOD. On the full test set and normal subset, fusion-based models achieve the excellent performance. However, in illumination challenge subset, the top event-based model outperforms all fusion models, while fusion models still outperform their RGB-based counterparts, indicating limits of existing fusion methods when the frame modality is severely degraded.

To address the scarcity of annotated data, a popular solution is unsupervised domain adaptation, which has been extensively studied in unimodal settings yet remains less explored in multimodal settings. In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous multimodal domain adaptation, where the primary challenge is the varying domain shifts of different modalities from the source to the target domain. We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem. Further approximation yields a closed-form solution, leading to an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm.

Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) methods fail under misalignment, while No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods struggle with generalization. In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods. We train exclusively on synthetically generated distortions, deliberately avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples and thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references. We also conducted a novel user study to gather data on human preferences when viewing non-aligned references in NVS.

However, current LULC models are typically developed for a specific modality and a fixed class taxonomy, limiting their generability and broader applicability. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance. We evaluate LandSegmenter on six precisely annotated LULC datasets spanning diverse modalities and class taxonomies.

Considering the data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes, we introduce two key components to ensure the effective learning of DistZSL: a cross-node attribute regularizer and a global attribute-to-visual consensus. Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes. Specifically, we enforce the bilateral mapping between the attribute and visual feature distributions to be consistent across different nodes.

However, existing methods focus on the reconstruction of visible regions, while the generation of occluded regions relies only on the generative prior of 3D GAN. As a result, the generated occluded regions often exhibit poor quality due to the information loss caused by the low bit-rate latent code. To address this, we introduce the warping-and-inpainting strategy to incorporate image inpainting into 3D GAN inversion and propose a novel 3D GAN inversion method, WarpGAN. Specifically, we first employ a 3D GAN inversion encoder to project the single-view image into a latent code that serves as the input to 3D GAN.

Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs) highlight the potential of automatic UI coding, but current approaches face two key limitations: multimodal coding capabilities remain underdeveloped, and single-turn paradigms make little use of iterative visual feedback. We address these challenges with an interactive UI-to-code paradigm that better reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance. Under this paradigm, we present UI2Code$^\\text{N}$, a visual language model trained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding.

We further explore test-time scaling for interactive generation, enabling systematic use of multi-turn feedback.

We evaluate a system integrating a specialized visual backbone (EfficientNet-B4) with a powerful generative large language model (Google's Gemini LLM). The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and the quality of generative output (nutritional data and recipes). We benchmark this pipeline against alternative vision backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and a lightweight LLM (Gemma). We introduce a formalization for \"Semantic Error Propagation\" (SEP) to analyze how classification inaccuracies from the visual module cascade into the generative output. Our analysis is grounded in a new Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) developed to address cultural bias in public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that while EfficientNet-B4 (89.0\\% Top-1 Acc.) provides the best balance of accuracy and efficiency, and Gemini (9.2/10 Factual Accuracy) provides superior generative quality, the system's overall utility is fundamentally bottlenecked by the visual front-end's perceptive accuracy.

In this study, we propose a method that improves reconstruction accuracy and efficiency by adaptively modulating the spacing and size of local regions based on the curvature of the input point cloud.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u66f2\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u8ddd\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5747\u5300\u653e\u7f6e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u5165\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u8c03\u8282\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u95f4\u8ddd\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

While textual context often highlights semantic relationships within an image, existing fine-tuning methods typically overlook this information when aligning vision and language, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Toward solving this problem, we propose a method that can improve multimodal alignment and fusion based on both semantics and relationships.Specifically, we first extract multilevel semantic features from different vision encoder to capture more visual cues of the relationships. Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation.

This spatial diffusion process encourages propagation across connected and semantically related areas, enabling it to effectively delineate objects with arbitrary shapes.

Existing works primarily follow the localize-editing paradigm, focusing on independent object localization and editing while neglecting critical inter-object interactions. However, this work points out that the neglected attention entanglements in inter-object conflict regions, inherently hinder disentangled multi-object editing, leading to either inter-object editing leakage or intra-object editing constraints. We thereby propose a novel multi-layer disentangled editing framework LayerEdit, a training-free method which, for the first time, through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, enables conflict-free object-layered editing. Specifically, LayerEdit introduces a novel \"decompose-editingfusion\" framework, consisting of: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition module, which utilizes an attention-aware IoU scheme and time-dependent region removing, to enhance conflict awareness and suppression for layer decomposition. (2) Object-layered Editing module, to establish coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, achieving disentangled semantic and structural modifications.

To address this, we introduce ImageBindDC, a novel data condensation framework operating within the unified feature space of ImageBind. Our approach moves beyond conventional distribution-matching by employing a powerful Characteristic Function (CF) loss, which operates in the Fourier domain to facilitate a more precise statistical alignment via exact infinite moment matching. We design our objective to enforce three critical levels of distributional consistency: (i) uni-modal alignment, which matches the statistical properties of synthetic and real data within each modality; (ii) cross-modal alignment, which preserves pairwise semantics by matching the distributions of hybrid real-synthetic data pairs; and (iii) joint-modal alignment, which captures the complete multivariate data structure by aligning the joint distribution of real data pairs with their synthetic counterparts. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of ImageBindDC: on the NYU-v2 dataset, a model trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieves lossless performance comparable to one trained on the full dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art with an 8.2\\% absolute improvement over the previous best method and more than 4$\\times$ less condensation time.", "AI": {"tldr": "ImageBindDC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728ImageBind\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u635f\u5931\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728ImageBind\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u635f\u5931\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u65e0\u9650\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728NYU-v2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u7c7b5\u4e2a\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u53478.2%\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c114\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "ImageBindDC\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

Folder-based annotation workflows are usually slow, fatiguing, and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce SWipeable ANnotations (SWAN), an open-source, MIT-licensed web application that enables intuitive image patch classification using a swiping gesture. SWAN supports both desktop and mobile platforms, offers real-time metadata capture, and allows flexible mapping of swipe gestures to class labels. In a pilot study with four pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure image patches, we compared SWAN against a traditional folder-sorting workflow. SWAN enabled rapid annotations with pairwise percent agreement ranging from 86.52% to 93.68% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.61-0.80), while for the folder-based method, the pairwise percent agreement ranged from 86.98% to 91.32% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.63-0.75) for the task of classifying atypical versus normal mitotic figures, demonstrating high consistency between annotators and comparable performance. Participants rated the tool as highly usable and appreciated the ability to annotate on mobile devices.

However, existing fusion methods are often either highly task-specific, or general frameworks that apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability.

State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods. Experiments on Human3.6M-Occ and Occlusion-Person demonstrate robustness to occlusions, without scenario-specific fine-tuning.

In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces the negative flip rate with high overall accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u7684\u8d1f\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff08negative flips\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e4b\u524d\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u6821\u51c6\u9879\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u91cd\u6e90\u7126\u70b9\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8d1f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u65ad\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u7248\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u51b2\u7a81\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8d1f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6821\u51c6\u9879\u6765\u9f13\u52b1\u539f\u59cb\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u4e4b\u95f4\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u53cc\u91cd\u6e90\u7126\u70b9\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ece\u65b0\u65e7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8d1f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u7684\u8d1f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u754c\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u6e90\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6dfb\u52a0\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

By leveraging deep learning-based risk models, screening intervals can be personalized, especially for high-risk individuals. While recent methods increasingly incorporate longitudinal information from prior mammograms, accurate spatial alignment across time points remains a key challenge. Misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade model performance. In this study, we provide insights into various alignment strategies, image-based registration, feature-level (representation space) alignment with and without regularization, and implicit alignment methods, for their effectiveness in longitudinal deep learning-based risk modeling. Using two large-scale mammography datasets, we assess each method across key metrics, including predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.\n  Our results show that image-based registration consistently outperforms the more recently favored feature-based and implicit approaches across all metrics, enabling more accurate, temporally consistent predictions and generating smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Although regularizing the deformation field improves deformation quality, it reduces the risk prediction performance of feature-level alignment. Applying image-based deformation fields within the feature space yields the best risk prediction performance.\n  These findings underscore the importance of image-based deformation fields for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness.

In recent years, large-scale pretrained visual foundation models, exemplified by DINO, have advanced rapidly and demonstrated remarkable performance on complex downstream tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that DINO can serve as an effective feature learner for UIS, and we introduce DiveSeg, a novel framework built upon two insightful components: (1) The AquaStyle Aligner, designed to embed underwater color style features into the DINO fine-tuning process, facilitating better adaptation to the underwater domain. (2) The ObjectPrior Prompter, which incorporates binary segmentation-based prompts to deliver object-level priors, provides essential guidance for instance segmentation task that requires both object- and instance-level reasoning.

However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5SASG-DA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3asEMG\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u5fe0\u5b9e\u53c8\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "sEMG\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u5eb7\u590d\u548c\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSASG-DA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u9ad8\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u591a\u6837\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff1b3\uff09\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\u6b20\u8868\u793a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ninapro DB2\u3001DB4\u548cDB7\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSASG-DA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SASG-DA\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86sEMG\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns. We demonstrate the approach on simulated whole-body motion artifacts and observe robust correction across varying motion severity. Our results suggest that the model effectively disentangled physical motion of the simulated motion-effective scans, therefore, improving the generalizability of the ML-based MRI motion correction.

The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8d28\u7591\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801(RoPE)\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u7403\u9762RoPE\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e9a\u4e8e\u7b49\u53d8\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76RoPE\u6210\u529f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u662f\u5426\u662f\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7403\u9762RoPE\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6df7\u5408RoPE\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7403\u9762RoPE\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u7b49\u53d8\u7248\u672c\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u901a\u5e38\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u90a3\u4e48\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u5c06\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u89c9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5fc5\u987b\u662f\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9884\u8bbe\u89c2\u5ff5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{RAPTR} (RAdar Pose esTimation using tRansformer) under weak supervision, using only 3D BBox and 2D keypoint labels which are considerably easier and more scalable to collect. Our RAPTR is characterized by a two-stage pose decoder architecture with a pseudo-3D deformable attention to enhance (pose/joint) queries with multi-view radar features: a pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses with a 3D template loss designed to utilize the 3D BBox labels and mitigate depth ambiguities; and a joint decoder refines the initial poses with 2D keypoint labels and a 3D gravity loss. Evaluated on two indoor radar datasets, RAPTR outperforms existing methods, reducing joint position error by $34.3\\%$ on HIBER and $76.9\\%$ on MMVR.

Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge. Furthermore, the Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing its strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Anatomy-VLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u878d\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u6765\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u6574\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2. \u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e30\u5bcc\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b3. \u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "Anatomy-VLM\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "Anatomy-VLM\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that with only a small amount of pre-training data, we can transform a VLM into a competitive embedding model.

Modeling the progression of such expertize in humans remains challenging, and accurately inferring a human learner's knowledge state is a key step toward understanding visual learning. We introduce CleverBirds, a large-scale knowledge tracing benchmark for fine-grained bird species recognition. Collected by the citizen-science platform eBird, it offers insight into how individuals acquire expertize in complex fine-grained classification. More than 40,000 participants have engaged in the quiz, answering over 17 million multiple-choice questions spanning over 10,000 bird species, with long-range learning patterns across an average of 400 questions per participant. We release this dataset to support the development and evaluation of new methods for visual knowledge tracing.

Website: https://univa.online/", "summary": "While specialized AI models excel at isolated video tasks like generation or understanding, real-world applications demand complex, iterative workflows that combine these capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

However, obtaining precise camera poses in real-world settings remains challenging, even when calibration parameters are known. This limits the practicality of existing NeRF-based methods that rely heavily on accurate extrinsic estimates. Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use.

Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, a clinically crucial aspect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSENCA-st\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u80bf\u7624\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u533a\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6574\u5408\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6781\u7aef\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u666e\u901a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7a81\u51fa\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u529f\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u90fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u9677\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e2d\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSENCA-st\uff08\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u90bb\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4fdd\u7559\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e0a\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e0a\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u80bf\u7624\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u80bf\u7624\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "SENCA-st\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5404\u81ea\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7a81\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u764c\u75c7\u836f\u7269\u8010\u836f\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u4e9a\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
